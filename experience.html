<div>The best experience that ever happened to me is when I went to Tanah Suci Makkah with my beloved parents. We went there after I finished my SPM in 2016. We went there for 2 weeks. I was at my peaceful phase of my life, ever. I feel so calm and feels like want to stay there forever. The environment and weather there were so good as I want there during the winter time. Thereâ€™s a lot of place I have visited such as camel farm, Makam Sahabat Nabi and Kurma farm. It was the best experience I ever had and I hope I still get the chance to go there again with all my family members together.</div>
